# Pull Request: HelloClaydou Plugin Improvements

## Overview
This pull request addresses several issues identified during a code review of the HelloClaydou plugin. The changes improve code quality, fix potential bugs, enhance performance, and strengthen security.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed invalid XML in pom.xml
- Changed the invalid tag `<n>HelloClaydou</n>` to the proper Maven tag `<name>HelloClaydou</name>`

### 2. Added null checks in metadata handling methods
- Added null checks in `getInteractionState()`, `hasSeenPlayer()`, and other methods
- Added validation for entity and player objects throughout the code
- Added validation for location objects before performing calculations

### 3. Initialized metadata when spawning new pigs
- Added code to initialize metadata when a new pig is spawned via the `/claydou` command
- This ensures consistent behavior for all Claydou pigs

### 4. Optimized entity iteration in onDisable()
- Combined metadata checks to reduce redundancy
- Added null checks to prevent NullPointerExceptions

### 5. Improved exception handling
- Added specific exception handling for IllegalArgumentException
- Added more descriptive error messages for better debugging

### 6. Added player limits
- Added a maximum limit of pigs that a player can spawn (5)
- Added a method to count existing pigs per player

## Benefits
- **Improved Stability**: The addition of null checks and proper validation prevents crashes from NullPointerExceptions
- **Better Performance**: Optimized metadata handling and entity iteration reduces server load
- **Enhanced Security**: More specific exception handling and player limits prevent abuse
- **Consistent Behavior**: Proper initialization of metadata ensures all pigs behave as expected

## Testing
All changes have been tested to ensure they work as expected and don't introduce new issues.
