# Pull Request Execution Instructions

## Option 1: Using the Patch File

A patch file has been created that contains all the changes needed for the pull request. This file can be used to apply the changes to the repository without needing to push directly.

### Steps to Apply the Patch File:

1. Copy the `helloclaydou_improvements.patch` file to a location accessible by the repository maintainer.

2. The repository maintainer can apply the patch using the following command:
   ```
   git apply helloclaydou_improvements.patch
   ```

3. After applying the patch, the maintainer can commit and push the changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Apply improvements from patch file"
   git push
   ```

## Option 2: Manual Pull Request Creation

If you have access to the GitHub web interface, you can create a pull request manually:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub if you haven't already.

2. Clone your fork to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/HelloClaydou.git
   ```

3. Copy all the files from your current local repository to the cloned fork.

4. Commit and push the changes to your fork:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add internationalization, fix bugs, and improve code quality"
   git push
   ```

5. Go to your fork on GitHub and click the "Pull request" button.

6. Fill in the pull request details using the content from `PULL_REQUEST.md`.

## Option 3: Using GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can create a pull request directly from the command line:

1. Install GitHub CLI if you haven't already: https://cli.github.com/

2. Authenticate with GitHub:
   ```
   gh auth login
   ```

3. Create a pull request:
   ```
   gh pr create --title "Add internationalization, fix bugs, and improve code quality" --body-file PULL_REQUEST.md
   ```

## Option 4: Using HTTPS with Personal Access Token

If you want to push directly using HTTPS, you can use a personal access token instead of your password:

1. Create a personal access token on GitHub:
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
   - Click "Generate new token"
   - Select the necessary scopes (at least "repo")
   - Copy the generated token

2. Set the remote URL to use HTTPS:
   ```
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/InTieGames/HelloClaydou.git
   ```

3. When pushing, use your GitHub username and the personal access token as the password:
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```
