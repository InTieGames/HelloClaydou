# Pull Request Instructions

Since we couldn't push the changes directly due to authentication issues, here are the steps to manually create a pull request:

## 1. Push the Changes

You'll need to push the committed changes to the remote repository. There are several ways to do this:

### Using HTTPS (Recommended if SSH is not working)

```bash
# Configure Git to use HTTPS instead of SSH
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/HelloClaydou.git

# Push the changes
git push origin main
```

Replace `username` with your GitHub username or organization name.

### Using SSH (If you have the correct SSH key and passphrase)

```bash
# Push the changes
git push origin main
```

You'll be prompted for your SSH key passphrase.

## 2. Create a Pull Request on GitHub

1. Go to the GitHub repository page (https://github.com/username/HelloClaydou)
2. Click on the "Pull requests" tab
3. Click the "New pull request" button
4. Select the base branch (usually `main` or `master`) and the compare branch (your branch with changes)
5. Click "Create pull request"
6. Add a title for your pull request (e.g., "Add internationalization, fix bugs, and improve code quality")
7. In the description field, paste the content of the PULL_REQUEST.md file
8. Click "Create pull request" to submit

## 3. Alternative: Create a Patch File

If you can't push to the repository, you can create a patch file to share your changes:

```bash
# Create a patch file containing all your changes
git format-patch origin/main..HEAD --stdout > helloclaydou_improvements.patch
```

This will create a file called `helloclaydou_improvements.patch` that contains all your changes. You can share this file with the repository maintainer, who can apply it using:

```bash
git apply helloclaydou_improvements.patch
```

## 4. Important Files to Include

Make sure the following files are included in your pull request:

1. Modified files:
   - README.md
   - src/main/java/com/intiegames/divinecraft/helloclaydou/HelloClaydou.java
   - src/main/resources/plugin.yml

2. New files:
   - CHANGELOG.md
   - PULL_REQUEST.md
   - src/main/java/com/intiegames/divinecraft/helloclaydou/LanguageManager.java
   - src/main/resources/config.yml
   - src/main/resources/lang/ (directory with language files)

These files contain all the improvements made to the plugin, including internationalization, bug fixes, and code quality enhancements.
